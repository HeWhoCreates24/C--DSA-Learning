# C--DSA-Learning
# C++ and Data Structures Learning Journey ðŸ“š

## Week 1: Syntax, Conditionals, Loops, and Patterns

### What I Learned
- **Syntax**: Basics of C++.
- **Conditionals**: Using `if`, `else`, and `switch`.
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **Patterns**: Implemented various star and number patterns using nested loops.

### Coding Exercises
- Built a calculator.
- Calculated factorials.
- Created multiple patterns (including challenging ones).

### Challenges
- **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**: Initially struggled with the logic, but learned itâ€™s formula-based rather than logic-based.

### Resources
- **YouTube Channels**:

  - [Apna College - DSA Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLL1dOFHDp1kT4rxpI3hoZo)

### Next Steps
- Learn about functions and pointers.
